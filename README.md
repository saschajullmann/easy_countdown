#Easy Countdown

Small countdown timer that takes in a date and (optionally) a certain time and calculates the remaining days, hours, minutes, seconds.
The date is stored in localStorage, so the date is persistent until it either gets overwritten with a new date or the browser cache is emptied.

##Demo
A working demo is currently hosted [here](https://easycountdown-ueahnqrzri.now.sh/).

##Tools I used
It's a simple static site which uses HTML5, Pure Javascript and CSS. For CSS I used the awesome [Tachyons Framework](http://tachyons.io/), for hosting the site I used the
services of [Zeit](https://zeit.co). A Dockerfiles is also provided, but you don't really need that. Just open the index.html in your browser.
